      "\n",
      "1. **Indian Independence Movement**: Gandhi led the Indian National Congress in a non-violent struggle against British rule, using tactics such as civil disobedience, boycotts, and non-cooperation.\n",
      "2. **Salt March**: In 1930, Gandhi led a 24-day march from Ahmedabad to the coast of India to protest the British salt tax, which was a major source of income for the British government.\n",
      "3. **Quit India Movement**: In 1942, Gandhi launched the Quit India Movement, a mass civil disobedience campaign that called for British withdrawal from India.\n",
      "4. **Non-violent Resistance**: Gandhi's philosophy of non-violent resistance has inspired movements for civil rights and social justice around the world, including the American Civil Rights Movement led by Martin Luther King Jr.\n",

      "Gandhi's personal life was marked by simplicity, humility, and a commitment to non-violence. He was married to Kasturba Gandhi and had four sons. He was assassinated on January 30, 1948, by a Hindu nationalist who opposed his tolerance for Muslims.\n",
